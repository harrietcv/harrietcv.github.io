    <h1 class="general-heading">Useful Resources</h1>
    <p class="general-text">Sometimes a cheeky, vaguely humourous website isn’t enough to help you learn a new skill. That’s only fair – this website is intended as a kind of fun introduction and springboard to learning German and to help maybe spark an interest in learning it to a more advanced level that what I’m capable of currently offering.</p>

    <p class="general-text">I’ve put together a list of good resources that might make things a little easier – some are free, while some you’d have to buy (like textbooks) but are generally affordable and not <i>too</i> expensive. Armed with all the information on learning German at your disposal that you could ever possibly want, you’re going to go far!</p>

    <p class="general-text">Still, there’s an important caveat here: even with every single edition of Rosetta Stone, or hundreds of other language learning websites, apps, and so on, you’re not going to become fluent in any language. No, not even German, sadly. The only real way to learn a language is to actively work and communicate with its native speakers, and then to hopefully travel to the country itself in the future. Immersion is key, and the more exposure you have to media in a foreign language (even if you rely heavily on subtitles for a while!) then the easier it will get…. but no, a website by itself can’t make you fluent overnight.</p>

    <p class="general-text">That’s why you need several!</p>

    <br></br>

    <h2 class="general-heading">Apps</h2>
    <p class="general-text">Available on iOS and Android:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a class="general-link" href="https://www.duolingo.com/"><strong>Duolingo</strong></a> -a fun and free way to easily learn a wide variety of languages, you can choose your target language and also the language you want to be taught in, whether that’s English, Russian, Korean or several others! Duolingo tries to take a gamified approach to learning languages, turning lessons into activities that makes everything much more enjoyable. The app itself is free, though you can pay to remove adverts and work offline. </li>
      <li><a class="general-link" href="https://www.memrise.com/"><strong>Memrise</strong></a> -Memrise helps you learn lots of languages easily and on the go through quick exercises, watching videos of native speakers and more! It has a free and Pro mode. </li>
      <li><a class="general-link" href="https://languagedrops.com/"><strong>Drops</strong></a> - available for learning 30+ languages, Drops lets you practise and learn for 5 minutes each day. The intensity and short bursts of the sessions helps sustain focus and motivate you, but there is an option to pay for learning in longer periods of time. It also has a companion app, Scripts, for learning character-based languages.</li>
    </ul>

    <br></br>

    <h2 class="general-heading">Websites</h2>
      <ul class="general-text">
        <li><a class="general-link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/"><strong>BBC Languages</strong></a> - this website has really useful links to other resources that may be of interest, such as news, TV and radio, but also interviews with famous people from your target language’s country (German <a class="general-link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/german/">here</a>!) It has been archived now, though, so there won’t be any more updates, but all the information is still very valuable!</li>
        <li><a class="general-link" href="https://en.pons.com/p/online-dictionary/vocabulary-trainer)"><strong>Pons Vocabulary Trainer</strong></a> - offers a free set of exercises from the Pons dictionary people to help consolidate and practice learning vocabulary. The Pons dictionary itself is available <a class="general-link" href="https://en.pons.com/translate">online</a>, as well as in an app for iOS and Android, also in print form.</li>
        <li><a class="general-link" href="https://www.rosettastone.co.uk/learn-german/"><strong>Rosetta Stone</strong></a> -a tried and tested language-learning giant. You have to pay a monthly/annual subscription fee (although there is a free trial), but it gives you access to not only courses and exercises but also a store full of original-language literature to help boost your immersion and a unique tool that listens to and corrects pronunciation as you speak. It’s also available in iOS and Android apps.</li>
        <li><a class="general-link" href="https://www.rypeapp.com/"><strong>Rype</strong></a> - designed with hectic schedules in mind, Rype is the language learning solution for busy people. The lessons are online and only half an hour and take place with a native speaker whenever you want them to. You also only pay one subscription fee for access to 8 languages (including French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Italian and Mandarin Chinese). There is a 7 day trial available.</li>
